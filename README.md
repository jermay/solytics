# Solytics

Some basic analytics for Solana. Pulls in live data from on chain.

- Recent transactions per second
- Market caps for certain SPL tokens
- Some wallet balances

Tech stack:

- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs): monorepo manager, makes it easier to manage multiple projects and code sharing
  - It shows a separate UI package, but it was taken out for now as it wasn't clear how to manually set up shadcn/ui with it
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/): opinionated Node.js Typescript framework that encourages good practices
- [Solana Web3.js](https://solana.com/docs/clients/javascript): Solana blockchain javascript RPC client
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): UI framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): frontend build tool
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): atomic CSS for the win
- [Shadcn/ui](https://github.com/Shadcn/ui): clean, based on headless primitives from Radix, imports the code- it's not a component library so have full control

### TODO

- [ ] Frontend tests
- [ ] Backend tests
- [ ] Dockerize backend
- [ ] Redis instead of in NestJs default in memory cache

## Starting the project

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

    └── packages
        ├── @repo/api                 # Shared `NestJS` resources.
        ├── @repo/eslint-config       # `eslint` configurations (includes `prettier`)
        ├── @repo/jest-config         # `jest` configurations

        └── @repo/ui                  # Shareable stub React component library.

Each package and application are 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) safe.

### Utilities

This `Turborepo` has some additional tools already set for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type-safety
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Jest](https://prettier.io) & [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for testing

### Commands

This `Turborepo` already configured useful commands for all your apps and packages.

#### Build

```bash
# Will build all the app & packages with the supported `build` script.
pnpm run build

# ℹ️ If you plan to only build apps individually,
# Please make sure you've built the packages first.
```

#### Develop

```bash
# Will run the development server for all the app & packages with the supported `dev` script.
pnpm run dev
```

#### test

```bash
# Will launch a test suites for all the app & packages with the supported `test` script.
pnpm run test

# You can launch e2e testes with `test:e2e`
pnpm run test:e2e

# See `@repo/jest-config` to customize the behavior.
```

#### Lint

```bash
# Will lint all the app & packages with the supported `lint` script.
# See `@repo/eslint-config` to customize the behavior.
pnpm run lint
```

pnpm format
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```bash
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
npx turbo link
```
